git push origin main
Replace main with the branch name if it is different.
Step 3: Pull Updates from the GitHub Repository

This command fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local repository. Replace main with the branch name if it is different.

Additional Tips
Setting Up Authentication:
If you haven't set up authentication, you may need to enter your GitHub username and password or use an SSH key.

Branching:
It's often a good practice to work on a separate branch and merge changes back to the main branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b new-branch
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin new-branch
Resolving Conflicts:
If there are conflicts when pulling changes, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually before completing the merge.
